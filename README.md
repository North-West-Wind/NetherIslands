# Nether Islands
Generate the Nether like the End.

## Datapack
From 1.20.x onwards, this is no longer distributed as a mod, but a datapack, due to there being much better support from Minecraft and much better tools from the community.  
For instance, this datapack using [misode's editor](https://misode.github.io/worldgen/noise-settings).

In fact, if you want to edit this datapack, I recommend using that as well.  
However, if you only want to edit some very specific parameters that you could easily do with the mod, here's what to edit in the `nether.json` file:
- `noise_settings.minY` -> `noise.min_y`
- `noise_settings.height` -> `noise.height`
- `dimension_settings.sea_level` -> `sea_level`
- `dimension_settings.bedrockFloorPosition` -> Unfortunately very complicated. You'll have to edit noise router options as well, and I haven't figured it out yet.

Note that Minecraft may say the datapack is incompatible, but the datapack should work in all versions of 1.20(.x), and 1.21.

## Mod
Before 1.20, this is available as a mod from 1.16 to 1.19.
